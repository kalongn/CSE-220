I've renamed the encrypt function since it is creating issue. it is having name collision with unistd.h encrypt function and will not compile.

Instruction also unclear on the following
1. encryption method
    1. if both cipherText and PlaintText is null
        - do we return -1 as ciphertext doesn't have space to fit PlaintText (my implementation atm)
        - or do we return -2 as they are null
    2. Edge cases 2:
        - When we get an empty string, we need to make cipherText "Undefined__EOM__", 
          but what if cipherText doesn't have space to fit "Undefined__EOM__"
        - what do we return here, 0 or -1?
